## Overview

Personal portfolio website, created from the Gatsby JS.

Live version can be viewed at [narinsun.com](narinsun.com)

I've rebuilt my portfolio a few times. Version 1 was with Vanilla JS. Version 2 was styled same as Version 1, but I built it with Gatsby and React. Version 3 is a full re-write. Still used Gatsby, but add TypeScript, Framer-Motion for animations, and re-did the layout and components. Also added unit testing.
